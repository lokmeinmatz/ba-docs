\subsection{Milestones}
\label{subsec:milestone}
Specify the milestones of your upcoming project. Please describe when you plan to achieve which milestone and what artifact(s) or outcome will result from each milestone. Also, keep in mind what the goal of each milestone is.

        \textbf{Due date} & 2022-09-21 (Week $1$)\vspace{2mm}\\
        \textbf{Tasks} & Identifying and read other studies/thesis/papers about UI editors, HCI methods, bronfield development\\&Look through old HCI lectures\vspace{2mm}\\
        \textbf{Outcome} & A list of relevant papers, articles and possilby open source repositories\\
        & A list of applicable HCI methods and when and with whom they should be applied\\
        & A final text summarizing the main findings and approaches, which might be useful for my project. \vspace{2mm}\\
        \textbf{Goal} & General understanding of methods to build UIs and software with HCI methods in an constrained environment. Having a good foundation for discussing my results in the context of other people's work.\vspace{2mm}\\

        Due date & 2022-09-30 (Week $3$)\vspace{2mm}\\
        Tasks & Conduct HCI methods to evaulate current state and initial requirements with at least 4 persons from at least 2 diffrent resorts.\\
        & Prepare the codebases for front- and backend including unit tests, some basic UI wireframes to test layouts and diffrent pages\vspace{2mm}\\
        Outcome & A document condensing the outcomes of the survey / observations, including a TODO list derived from their initial requirements and the requirements of the company's software environment.\\

        Due date & 2022-10-21 (Week $5$)\vspace{2mm}\\
            Tasks & Modify or build an Editor that reads the provided JSON schema for the UI configs and allows modifying the JSON files describing the UI.\\
            & Adapt schema generators to support more metadata / annotations inside the code\vspace{2mm}\\
        Outcome & A editor view where users can manipulate the UI layout for an app.\\
        & Performance should be better than exisitng JSON editor implementations with the usual schema and config sizes (validate using production app clones).\vspace{2mm}\\
        Goal & Having a solid foundation of one of the core features of the editor, to change the UI structure, while beeing more usable than exisitng solutions\vspace{2mm}
