\label{app:interviews}

\begin{tabular}{l l}
  Date: & 6.10.22 \\
  \hline
  Usage: & "all the time"\\
  \hline
  Role: & project dev \\
  \hline
  Works for: & ca 8 months \\
  \hline
  Common task: & task: general structuring of websites \& apps
\end{tabular}
\\\\
Current workflow:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Opens editor with history search of chrome
  \item Parallel opens app / website
  \item does Styling changes on the website / app itself in dev tools
  \item copies changed files back into editor
  \item → not using preview
\end{itemize}

Uses manager UI for:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item seeing what file was merged
  \item reverting changes
\end{itemize}

First impression: overwhelmed of complexity, felt unintuitive\\
Onboarding was playing around with test app, no explicit storefront onboarding
\\\\
Common problems:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item views.json broken, no info what is the problem
  \item not seeing what changed inside files, have to remember everything
  \item No “commit” message
\end{itemize}

Quotes:
“Man muss sich dran gewöhnen, man muss sich selbst ein System bauen“ - Problematisch, sollte software selber providen

Observations during Mod. Obs.
views.json didn't work, he did not know why
used “copy raw json text” a lot -> indicates that editing json is faster than editing via UI editor
used preview popout

Ideas for improvements
Resizable file explorer
See if other people are editing same file / app?
In upload name set “changed file” and “change component”?
Link manager -> editor
Quick links to common files
Easy mode

\hrule
Date: 11.10.22
Usage: every day
Role: customer success
usage time: multiple years
common task: Small adaptions for customers, setting up new apps from cloned resources

Current workflow:
Opens editor with shortcut
Only used popout preview
does Styling changes on the website / app itself in dev tools
copies changed files back into editor
→ not using preview

Uses manager UI for:
Versions Lock \& Copy to release
Comparing files

Common problems:
views.json broken, no info what is the problem
slow performance
“internal”: a lot of versions copied around (in thesis: filter input relating to other software)

Quotes:
TODO

Observations during Mod. Obs.
No overview over overwrites
resources wild

Ideas for improvements
Upgrade Storefront: only show official released versions by default
Kolja doesn't like preview on side (Ref. Sandra uses it all the time!)
Uploads should be included in merge
Upload folders recursively
hide mac specific files
JSON validator

Sandra - 12.10.22
Usage: “most of her work”
Role: project dev
usage time: ca 1 year
common task: web kiosk migration \& bug fixes, kleine views anpassungen, styling, impression tracking

Current workflow:
open through history + typing name in URL
search app by manager name
“Noticed for all platforms”
Flow for renaming → views-json → messages.json (umständlich)
Merge ohne Name

Uses manager UI for:
merge problems
reset after broken merge
First impression:
peer2peer
probeapp
trial \& error

Common problems:
upgrade wurde nicht übertragen
App Menu changes not testable
merge not reliable
updates not transparent
Quotes:


Observations during Mod. Obs.
heavily uses side preview !! (ref to Kolja who doesn’t use it at all)
preview → right click → refresh frame

Ideas for improvements
change log
“more or less happy”
hide file manager completely

Micha - 11.10.22
Usage: “depends on task, for purple most of time”
Role: project dev
usage time: ca 1 year with breaks
common task: 
building new apps for customers
Current workflow:
always open tab
navigate to file
multiple browser tabs to work on files in parallel → can lead to inconsistencies in data or empty files
Uses manager UI for:
resets
see when data is ready
First impression:


Common problems:
Quotes:
Observations during Mod. Obs.
missing link manager → App is taking much time to figure out URL + app name
navigation betw. files slow
auto link view key → messages.json?
Ideas for improvements
