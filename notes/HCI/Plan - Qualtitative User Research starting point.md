# Goal(s)

### SMART criteria:
**Specific**: improveworkflow of users to modify dynamic resources 
**Measurable**: survery results regarding editability, confidence in changing resources etc.
**Assignable**: ? (for part 2 me & others, for part 1 not really applicable? [[Open Questions]])
**Realistic**: until start of december with base work, keep software open for extension in future!!


1. Find out about the current state of users:
- who is using the editor or manual upload/download
- how often is it used by diffrent user groups
- what are common tasks
- what are the common mistakes / problems that occur (formulate so they don't reflect mistakes on themselves with "I just need to learn more" etc)
2. Find out what ideas for improvements the users have:
- If no limits are given, what basic functionality would you expect from an editor
- Extract possible existing ideas about improvement
- Where should be the main focus during prototyping


# Participants
select through Non-probability sampling (too small user group for random prob. sampling)

# Structure:
For 1., moderated observation with subsequent eval (with user) seems fitting
For 2., derive outcome from 1. + user interview


total time: 30m
## Intro & explain goal an plan (< 5min)

## Moderated observation 10-15min
Task???
(maybe one storefront related and one for app menu?)
(idea: android top level folder to see if people notice second platform overwrite)

## Interview about improvements / wishes: 10 - 15min

Phase 1: current state & problems
-> to "remind" user of current state

- how often do you use editor
- common tasks ("explain a common day where you use the editor / resources")
- first experience? (onboarding)
- what was the thing last week that took the most for you to do?
- what was the biggest thing last week that was a probelm / anoyance to you?
- + spntaneous problems that showed during task

Phase 2: future & wishes

open mind: no limits, how would "ideal" tool look like and what functionality should it include
Ideas how to mitigate common problems


## give survey to fill out on their own

Survey has same structure as interview:
1. current state & problems
2. future & wishes

- mix of discrete questions (5 star, y/n etc.) and free text for feedback


1. How often do you use the storefront editor per week
2. how often do you use the manager "dynamic resources" UI per week
3. (free text?) If so, why use manager UI?

Idea: first rate small units, so user has longer thought process when rating "overall"
4. How rate App selection
5. How rate intuitivity of dyn resource structure
6. how rate editing functions
7. how rate error mitigation
8. how rate overall state of dyn resource view
9. how rate changed content inspection?
10. how rate editor performance
11. how rate overall site performance
12. how rate overall

Free form: 
13. 3 most common tasks
14. 3 most common problems

future questions:
15. how important is X to you
-> to rate backlog priority


For UX improvements:
16. Do you prefer mouse-focuses working or keyboard (shortcuts)
