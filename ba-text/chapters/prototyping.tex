\chapter{Prototyping}
\label{chap:prototyping} 

After collecting the initial user feedback, digital ``paper'' prototypes were created using Figma\footnote{Figma (\url{https://www.figma.com/}) is a design tool accessible through the browser for collaborative work on design projects.} to gather visualizations of possible UI layouts.
Two ideas emerged from the interviews: a (file-)editor-centric layout and a preview-centric layout.
\section{Editor centric vs. preview centric layout}

The \textbf{preview-centric layout} is inspired by popular generic website builders like \url{https://wix.com} or \url{https://wordpress.com}.
A preview-centric UI editor, also referred to as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor, lets the user directly interact with a preview of the final layout.
Often this means composing ``elements'' or ``blocks'' per drag and drop (1 and 2 in fig. \ref{fig:preview-centric}), and when a component is selected, additional options of this component can be configured (3 in fig. \ref{fig:preview-centric}).
This approach requires little cognitive transfer from the user, since the preview is at the same time the source of truth of the configuration.
On the other hand, this WYSIWYG approach is impractical when a lot of the data and parts of the UI are dynamically loaded and dependent on user state.
For example, a common use case for Purple apps is to show special offers only on one platform or to hide components for users who are not logged in.
Discovering and configuring these invisible elements can lead to confusion by the users.

\newpage
The \textbf{editor-centric layout} is inspired by modern text editors / \Gls{ide}s like VS Code (\url{https://code.visualstudio.com/}), which often referenced in the interviews.
This approach makes the underlying configuration structure more visible to the user, usually through text files.
The central pane is the editor for opened files with side panes for file management and selection, preview and more.
The familiarity of this layout, particularly to developers familiar with IDEs, could help new users adopt patterns they use in other tools.

For the UI editor, the choice fell on the editor-centric approach, for which the reasons are explained below.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Existing tools like \url{https://vwo.com/why-us/technology/visual-editor/} or WordPress are not suitable for the \Gls{experience}s structure, which was not designed for preview-based editing. The aforementioned issues with invisible or platform-dependent UI components are critical.
  \item Third-party libraries like Microsoft's Monaco Editor (\url{https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/}) can be integrated to create editor-centric UIs while implementing a custom preview-centric solution within the limited time frame of this thesis seemed more uncertain and complicated.
  \item The user base consists mostly of tech-affine people who are used to layouts of IDEs. As Jakob's Law of the Internet User Experience states, the user's understanding of a website is directly tied to their mental model of that system \cite{Nielsen:2000} and \cite[p. 2]{LawsOfUX:2020ys}. Introducing an unconventional workflow comes with the danger of confusing the user, causing mistakes, and potentially leading to dissatisfaction with the tool.
\end{itemize}
