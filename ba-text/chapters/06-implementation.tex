\chapter{6 - Implementation and deployment}
\label{chap:chapters} 


For the implementation, I tried to focus on user experience as well as developer experience, which includes fast reloads,
a good test infrastructure for unit- and end-to-end (in the folllowing e2e) tests and the continous integration and deployment pipeline.
\\
Again, there are restrictions imposed by the company's environment, from the programming languages used to the APIs and the build and deployment infrastructure.
But within these bounds, it seems worth it to evaluate diffrent approaches, libraries and more, to improve developer efficiency,
preventing errors and overall imrpoving the quality of the product.
\\
The restrictions made by the company where
\begin{itemize}
  \item Typescript as main language for frontend and backend
  \item React as frontend framework
  \item Nodejs as backend runtime
  \item Development and deployment of internal gitlab instance, and should run in a docker container on the company's Kubernetes cluster.
\end{itemize}

Mainly, the thoughts behind these restrictions are to ensure maintainablilty by using common languages and tooling, and to prevent fragmentation
across diffrent runtimes / software stacks etc.
