\section*{Summary}
The goal of the proposed thesis is to conceptualize and develop an UI Editor to create and configure Apps and Web-Apps for digital publishers. These Apps are based on an existing domain specific web framework, developed by \url{https://sprylab.com}. Apps are configured via dynamic resources, which contain all the styles, scripts and configs needed to render the customer's app on client devices.
To enable the targeted user groups like internal developers,
customer support and the customers (news and magazine publishers) to work more productive,
I want to collect their current painponts and ideas for improvement through various HCI methods and develop a new web-app to fulfill their requirements better.

As a baseline, this means a fast and easy to use interface which prevents user errors from happening or gives feedback on their actions, while also giving more advanced users the abilities they need to do their changes. The editor to configure the Apps UI should be proceduraly generated from the source files of the framework and be performant enough to handle large configurations.
