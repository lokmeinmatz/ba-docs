\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}

  \hline
  Usage: & "all the time"\\
  \hline
  Role: & project dev \\
  \hline
  Works for: & ca 8 months \\
  \hline
  Common task: & task: general structuring of websites \& apps
\end{tabularx}
\\\\
Current workflow:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Opens editor with history search of chrome
  \item Parallel opens app / website
  \item does Styling changes on the website / app itself in dev tools
  \item copies changed files back into editor
  \item → not using preview
\end{itemize}

Uses manager UI for:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item seeing what file was merged
  \item reverting changes
\end{itemize}

First impression: overwhelmed of complexity, felt unintuitive\\
Onboarding was playing around with test app, no explicit storefront onboarding
\\\\
Common problems:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item views.json broken, no info what is the problem
  \item not seeing what changed inside files, have to remember everything
  \item No “commit” message
\end{itemize}

Quotes:
“Man muss sich dran gewöhnen, man muss sich selbst ein System bauen“ - problematic as systems of different users might be incompatible.

Observations during moderated observation
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item views.json didn't work, he did not know why
  \item used “copy raw json text” a lot -> indicates that editing json is faster than editing via extra tools
  \item used preview popout
\end{itemize}

Ideas for improvements
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Resizable file explorer
  \item See if other people are editing same file / app?
  \item In upload name set “changed file” and “change component”?
  \item Link manager -> editor
  \item Quick links to common files
  \item Easy mode
\end{itemize}

  \hline
  Usage: & "every day at least once"\\
  \hline
  Role: & customer success team \\
  \hline
  Works for: & multiple years \\
  \hline
  Common task: &  Small adaptions for customers, setting up new apps from cloned resources
\end{tabularx}
\\\\


Current workflow:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Opens editor with shortcut
  \item Only used popout preview
  \item does Styling changes on the website / app itself in dev tools
  \item copies changed files back into editor → not using preview
\end{itemize}

Uses manager UI for:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Versions Lock \& Copy to release
  \item Comparing files (download, unzip, use extra software to compare folders)
\end{itemize}

Common problems:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item views.json broken, no info what is the problem
  \item slow performance
  \item “internal”: a lot of versions copied around (in thesis: filter input relating to other software)
\end{itemize}

Observations during moderated observation
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item No overview over overwrites of different platforms
  \item resources not cleaned up -> no templates
\end{itemize}

Ideas for improvements
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Upgrade Storefront: only show official released versions by default
  \item Person doesn't like preview on side (Ref. working student uses it all the time!)
  \item Uploads should be included in merge
  \item Upload folders recursively
  \item hide mac specific files
  \item JSON validator to show detailed where the error is
\end{itemize}

  \hline
  Usage: & "most of work in dynamic resources"\\
  \hline
  Role: & project dev / support customer success \\
  \hline
  Works for: & 1 year \\
  \hline
  Common task: &  web kiosk migration \& bug fixes, small views adaptions, styling, impression tracking
\end{tabularx}
\\\\
Current workflow:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item open through history + typing name in URL
  \item search app by manager name
  \item Noticed challenge if mod. observation task to see all platform overwrites
  \item Flow for renaming of translation → views-json → messages.json cumbersome
  \item Merge without clear description for others what change contained
\end{itemize}
Uses manager UI for:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item merge problems
  \item reset after broken merge
\end{itemize}
First impression: pair "programming" sessions on extra test app, lots of trial and error

Common problems:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]  
  \item upgrades not automatically, lots of manual steps involved -> more change of errors
  \item App Menu changes not testable without restarting real app
  \item merge not reliable, deleted files don't get deleted from ZIP file
  \item updates not transparent what changed
\end{itemize}


Observations during moderated observation
\begin{itemize}[nosep]  
  \item Heavily uses side preview (ref to customer success member who doesn't use it at all)
  \item preview → right click → refresh frame
\end{itemize}

Ideas for improvements
\begin{itemize}[nosep]  
  \item change log
  \item hide file manager completely if not needed
  \item “Ansonsten mehr oder weniger zufrieden” - more or less happy
\end{itemize}

  Role: & project dev / other business unit \\
  \hline
  Works for: & ca. 1 year with breaks \\
  \hline
  Common task: &  building new apps for customers
\end{tabularx}
\\\\
Current workflow:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item always open tab, a person that never closes tabs :)
  \item navigate to file
  \item multiple browser tabs to work on files in parallel → can lead to inconsistencies in data or empty files
\end{itemize}
Uses manager UI for:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item reset of broken changes
  \item see when data is ready to be delivered to apps / websites
\end{itemize}

First impression: -\\
Common problems: -\\
Observations during moderated observation:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item missing link manager → App is taking much time to figure out URL + app name
  \item navigation between files slow
  \item auto link view key → messages.json when adding new translations
\end{itemize}
