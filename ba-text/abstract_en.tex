\chapter{Abstract}

In recent years, the shift from print to digital publishing has increased the need for tools that allow publishers to quickly build and configure apps and websites.
\\\\
The goal of this bachelor thesis is to conceptualize, plan, and implement an UI editor for apps and websites used by magazine and news publishers, particularly in Germany and the UK.
The editor was built for a properitary web framework called "Purple Experience" and was developed within the constraints of an existing software ecosystem, which posed challenges and limitations on the design and implementation of the tool.
\\
To gain insights into the needs and workflows of the groups of users who will be using the editor, a variety of HCI methods were applied during the user research phase, including moderated observations and interviews. 
\\\\
The outcome of this research is useful as guidance for future software development projects for internal tools at companies, or in environments where constraints exist but a user base is already in place to provide valuable input and feedback. As a result of the user research phase, an interactive prototype was built using modern web technologies and was deployed to a controlled group of test users. This allowed for quick feedback and fast iteration until the tool was ready for a broader audience.
