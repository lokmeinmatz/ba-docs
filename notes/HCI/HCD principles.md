# factors
"A product, service or interface that is not accessible is not usable"
*hci.1 p39f* [[1 Learn Human-Computer Interaction Becker]]

## Usability factor
- "ease of use"
- is a spectrum
- "scored and based on a set of design features based on a set of human-centered tasks"
- "... determine what a user wants to do with their environment"

## Accessibility factor
- "widest saudience possible in the widest set of environments possible" 

## Time-on-task factor
"... design solutions that use up the appropriate amount of time to solve a problem"

**user's time expectations** <-> **system's time requirements**


Users use computers and software in a constant learning feedback loop -> system designers can push users into bad or good behaviours
-> **identify bad behaviours quickly**

"behaviour is reinforced through a software interface" hci.1 p52

**Example from hci.1 p66f:**
Alarm app is made habitual, users must trust the alarm app to work properly!

## Double Diamond design process
hci.1 p71
- research
- emphatize
- define
- ideate ??
- prototype
- test
- deploy

# Lean UX
src: hci.4
- small work packages inside agile development process
- Continuous Discovery: qualtitative and quantitative methods to test expectations and learn users
- "Getting Out Of The Building"
- vizualize and present often
## process
1. problem definition
	- goal of the product
	- problems to solve
	- "what are we able to do"
2. declare assumptions
	- success criteria
	- DoD
	- mesuarable change in user expeirence
	- user groups
	- goals / tasks of users
	- functionality
	- "Proto-Persona": imaginary person doing an specific job to validate that prototypes fulfill needs
