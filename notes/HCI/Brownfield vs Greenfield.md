> **Brownfield development** is characterised by the addition of new capabilities on an existing product or product platform, using existing technology and by further developing competence in known areas. This type of development is done to ‘sustain’ (Christensen, 2016) an innovation andcan still generate innovative solutions. Here, existing methodologycan be reused or potentially improved. 
> 
> If the existing product is developed continuously,it means that existing employeescan repeat a known devel-opment process to gradually expand the capabilities of the system. Such a situation allows for con-tinuous stepwise improvements both in terms of productivity and product capability, as long as the constraints ofthe underlying architecture are not challenged. Brownfield  development  has  attractive  aspects  in  many  regards,  which  also  are  discussed  in  e.g.Synoptek (2018).
> Some of them are: 
> - People have the opportunity to performtasks several times–previous experience is utilised
> - The basis (product, methodology) is known –allowing for incremental changes and continu-ous improvements
> - The product under development is well understood –known benefits, constraints and low risk
> 
> **Greenfield development** is in its most distinct form when a new product is created from scratch–a new product or product platform, based on new technology, using new methodologyand implemented by people who are new to it all.
> 
> Here competences are explored and developed in previously unknown areas. The people in the organisation may be very experienced overall, but inexperienced in this new field.  There are many attractive aspects of Greenfield development –providinga clean slate and theop-portunity  to  implement  state-of-the-art  technology.  It  removes  all  compulsion  to  work  within  the constraints  of  existing  systems  or  infrastructure  and  there  are  no  dependencies  or  ties  to  existing technology,  preconceived  notions,  or  existing  business  processes,  as  described  in  e.g.Synoptek (2018).
> Starting over allows for the use of the latest materials and technology,opening up for a dis-ruption in product capabilities versus cost. It allows for correction of known design flaws in legacy products and the inherent limitations of the last generation implementations –a particularly attractive opportunity in long-lived systems. Starting over also allows for replacing obsolete enabling systems,opening up for productivity improvements and for making the workplace more attractive.
