\section*{Summary}
The goal of the proposed thesis is to conceptualize and develop an UI Editor to create and configure Apps and Web-Apps for digital publishers.
The Apps are based on an existing domain specific web framework, developed by \url{https://sprylab.com}.
Apps are configured via dynamic resources, which contain all the styles, scripts and configs needed to render the customer's app on client devices.
The concreate goal of the software is to enable the targeted user groups like internal developers,
customer support and the customers (news and magazine publishers) to work more productive and confident.

In the context of HCI, the focus will be on applying diffrent quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the user's needs and the state of the project, using agile development cycles to quickly test changes.
Because this thesis will be written in an company with existing frameworks, customers and external APIs and flows that are fixed, all these methods get evaulated in an production environment with a lot of constraints, where the new Editor needs to be integrated into.
While this limits the flexibility during the concept phase, it provides an large and diverse possible user base to see the effects and also perform quantitative surveys / Analytics.
